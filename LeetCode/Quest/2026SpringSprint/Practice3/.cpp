Q1. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Q2. Course Schedule
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.
For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.

Q3. Number of Visible People in a Queue
There are n people standing in a queue, and they numbered from 0 to n - 1 in left to right order. You are given an array heights of distinct integers where heights[i] represents the height of the ith person.
A person can see another person to their right in the queue if everybody in between is shorter than both of them. More formally, the ith person can see the jth person if i < j and min(heights[i], heights[j]) > max(heights[i+1], heights[i+2], ..., heights[j-1]).
